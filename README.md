##  Game Concept

Fusion Grid reimagines 2048 by letting tiles merge not only by doubling but by arithmetic logic based on selected number bases (e.g., base-3, base-4). Additions, subtractions, and divisions create dynamic gameplay — with Endless Mode, move limits, and penalty tiles.

##  How to Play

- Use arrow keys (← ↑ → ↓) to shift tiles
- Combine compatible tiles based on active rule
- Avoid penalties (e.g., negative tiles)
- Win by reaching the target tile or play endlessly

##  Features

- ✅ Standard and Endless Modes  
- ✅ Operator tiles: + − × ÷  
- ✅ Move limit with warnings & penalty  
- ✅ Tooltip system  
- ✅ Score logic adapts to operator type  
-  AI autoplay modes coming soon  
-  Base-switching support (e.g. 3-based, 4-based...)
