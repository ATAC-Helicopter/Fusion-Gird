## 🧠 Game Concept

Fusion Grid reimagines 2048 by combining classic sliding mechanics with dynamic operator tiles. Each operator tile (+, −, ×, ÷) merges with a neighbor to create a new result tile. The game adds complexity through move limits, thresholds, warnings, bonus points, blocking tiles, penalties, and a planned AI system.

## 🎮 How to Play

- Slide tiles using arrow keys (← ↑ → ↓)
- Merge tiles using visible operators
- Reach 2048 to win — or continue in Endless Mode


## Game Rules (Updated)

### Operator Merging
- Operator tiles (`+`, `−`, `×`, `÷`) merge with one adjacent tile in the direction of movement to create a new result tile.
- Results are calculated as:
  - `+`: addition
  - `−`: absolute difference
  - `×`: multiplication
  - `÷`: division (only if evenly divisible)
- Only one merge per tile per move.
- Weak merges below a dynamic threshold trigger warnings or penalties.

### Tile Spawning
- New tiles spawn as either 2 (90%) or 4 (10%) in random empty cells.

### Movement & Board
- Classic 4×4 grid.
- Tiles move fully in the chosen direction; no diagonal moves or chain reactions.

### Move Limit and Progression
- Players have 180 moves by default (disabled in Endless Mode).
- The minimum tile value required increases every 10 moves (starting at 8).
- Failure to reach this threshold within a grace period results in elimination.

### Warnings and Penalties
- Weak merges below the threshold issue warnings (up to 3 allowed).
- After warnings are used, further weak merges reduce the move limit by 10 moves.
- Repeated offenses cause elimination (game over).
- Warnings and penalties are disabled in Endless Mode.

### Bonus Points and Blocking Tiles
- Merge tiles valued 128 or greater to earn bonus points.
- Spend 2 bonus points to remove a blocking tile that obstructs movement.
- Blocking tiles prevent tile movement until removed.

### Win Condition
- The player wins by creating a tile with value exactly 2048.
- After winning, Endless Mode can be enabled.

### Endless Mode
- Disables move limits, warnings, penalties, and blocking tiles.
- Can be started from the main menu or after winning.
- Allows continuous play for high scores.
